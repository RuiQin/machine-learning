This repository contains my projects for course Machine Learning

1. linear regression and classification + 1
For the linear regression, two algorithms are used: batch gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent algorithm.
For the classification, two algorithms are used: batch perceptron and voted perceptron.

2. naive bayes classifer
Use naive bayes classifer for document classification, stop words were used to reduce vocabulary size and improve the classification result

3. Bagging & AdaBoost
Implement two ensemble methods: bagging and adaBoost
